# BasicPasswordValidator

Hello everyone, Welcome to my very first Python Project!

This script is a basic password validator that I created as I’m learning Python and exploring the world of programming. It’s designed to help users ensure their passwords are strong by checking for some basic criteria:

- Minimum length of 8 characters: Because short passwords are easier to crack.
- At least one uppercase letter: To add some complexity.
- At least one lowercase letter: To ensure a mix of characters.
- At least one numerical digit: Because numbers make it harder for attackers to guess.

## How It Works

When you run the script, it will ask you to enter a password and then check it against the criteria mentioned above. If your password doesn’t meet all the requirements, it will let you know what’s missing and give you the chance to try again until you get it right. It’s a simple but effective way to make sure your passwords are a bit stronger.

## Why I Built This

As someone aspiring to deepen my skills in cybersecurity, building this password validator is a stepping stone toward understanding how to secure systems and data. Strong passwords are a fundamental aspect of security, and this project helped me get hands-on with concepts that are crucial in the field. My goal is to continuously build and improve tools like this as I advance in my cybersecurity career.
